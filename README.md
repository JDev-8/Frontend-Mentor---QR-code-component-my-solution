# Frontend Mentor - QR code component my solution

This is a solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). Taking Frontend Mentor's design as a reference, I developed this project using HTML and CSS. I focused on faithfully recreating the layout and styles, putting my web design skills into practice.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Thanks to this exercise, I have been able to see how the theoretical concepts of responsive web design, such as 'mobile first', translate into practical and effective solutions. By experimenting with HTML and CSS in a real project, I have gained greater confidence in my ability to create web designs responsive to different devices and screen sizes.
